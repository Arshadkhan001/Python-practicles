#write a python program to demonstrate working with tuple in python

#tuple are immutable cannot be chang after declaration
# Create a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Access elements in the tuple
first_element = my_tuple[0]
second_element = my_tuple[1]

# Printing element in tuple 
print("First element:", first_element)
print("Second element:", second_element)

#adding new tuple into previous tuple
new_tuple = my_tuple + (6, 7, 8)

# Print the new tuple
print("New tuple:", new_tuple)
